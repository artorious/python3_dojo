Whn in th Cours of human vnts, it bcoms ncssary for on popl to dissolv
th political bands which hav connctd thm with anothr, and to assum among th
powrs of th arth, th sparat and qual station to which th Laws of Natur and
of Naturâ€™s God ntitl thm, a dcnt rspct to th opinions of mankind rquirs
that thy should dclar th causs which impl thm to th sparation.
W hold ths truths to b slf-vidnt, that all mn ar cratd qual, that thy ar
ndowd by thir Crator with crtain unalinabl Rights, that among ths ar Lif,
Librty and th pursuit of Happinss.--That to scur ths rights, Govrnmnts ar
institutd among Mn, driving thir just powrs from th consnt of th govrnd,
--That whnvr any Form of Govrnmnt bcoms dstructiv of ths nds, it is th
Right of th Popl to altr or to abolish it, and to institut nw Govrnmnt,
laying its foundation on such principls and organizing its powrs in such form,
as to thm shall sm most likly to ffct thir Safty and Happinss. Prudnc,
indd, will dictat that Govrnmnts long stablishd should not b changd for
light and transint causs; and accordingly all xprinc hath shwn, that mankind
ar mor disposd to suffr, whil vils ar suffrabl, than to right thmslvs by
abolishing th forms to which thy ar accustomd. But whn a long train of abuss
and usurpations, pursuing invariably th sam Objct vincs a dsign to rduc thm
undr absolut Dspotism, it is thir right, it is thir duty, to throw off such
Govrnmnt, and to provid nw Guards for thir futur scurity.--Such has bn th
patint suffranc of ths Colonis; and such is now th ncssity which constrains
thm to altr thir formr Systms of Govrnmnt. Th history of th prsnt King
of Grat Britain is a history of rpatd injuris and usurpations, all having in
dirct objct th stablishmnt of an absolut Tyranny ovr ths Stats. To prov
this, lt Facts b submittd to a candid world.
