""" Horse Race Simulation Program """
### THE PROBLEM
# Create a visualisation  of a horse race in which horses are moved ahead at
# random distance at fixed intervals until there is a winner
### PROGRAM DESIGN
# Meeting the program requirements
    # Create an appropriate simulation of a 10 horse race
# Data description
    # Current location of each of the 10 horses in a given race
    # Maintain 10 turtle objects (attributes include shape & coordinates)
    # Use/create suitable horse images
# Algorithmic approach
    # Advance each horse at a random distance at fixed intervals until one
    # reaches a certain point on the turtle screen (finish line)

### OVERALL STEPS
    # Initialize Turtle Graphics
    # Execute race horse simulation
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# TODO: Create an Initial Turtle Screen Layout
# Layout positions of the starting horses on the turtle graphics screen
