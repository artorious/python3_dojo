    Prime Generation with a List - implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes 
    in a Python function.

    Uses an algorithm developed by the Greek mathematician Eratosthenes who 
    lived from 274 B.C. to 195 B.C. Called the Sieve of Eratosthenes, 
    the principle behind the algorithm is simple: 

    Make a list of all the integers two and larger. 
    Two is a prime number, but any multiple of two cannot be a prime number 
    (since a multiple of two has two as a factor). Go through the rest of the 
    list and mark out all multiples of two (4, 6, 8, ...). 
    Move to the next number in the list (in this case, three). 
    If it is not marked out, it must be prime, 
    so go through the rest of the list and mark out all multiples of that 
    number (6, 9, 12, ...). Continue this process until you have listed 
    all the primes you want.
