""" Sierpinski Triangle Program (Fractals)

A turtle graphics program that generates Sierpinski triangles at various 
levels of repetition.This program utilizes recursive functions

NOTE:
    The Sierpinski triangle is an example of a fractal. A fractal is a shape 
    that contains parts that are similar to the whole shape, thus having the 
    property of self-similarity

#   triangle with three smaller triangles.

# get_left_triangle_position, get_right_triangle_position,get_top_triangle_position 
# respectively, both the length of the sides of the triangle, as well as its 
# height are needed.
