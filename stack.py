""" A simple programmer-defined stack module - Implemented as a list

Module contains a set of functions that implement stack behavior

Stacks are used to temporarily store and retrieve data.
The last item placed on the stack is the first to be retrieved. 
LIFO - Last In First Out. 
A stack can be viewed as a list that can be accessed only at one end.
